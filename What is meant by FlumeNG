	Flume NG is a refactoring of Flume and was originally tracked in FLUME-728.
	To solve certain known issues and limitations, Flume requires a refactoring of some core classes and systems. This bug is a parent issue to track the development of a "Flume NG". Subtasks should be added to track individual systems and components.
	This is a large and far reaching set of tasks. The intent is to perform this work in a branch as to not disrupt immediate releases or short term forthcoming releases while still allowing open development in the community.
	Flume NG's high level architecture solidifies a few concepts from Flume OG and drastically simplifies others. As our goals state, we are focused on a streamlined codebase that meets the common use cases in a "batteries included," easy to use, easy to extend package. Flume NG retains Flume OG's general approach to data transfer and handling.
